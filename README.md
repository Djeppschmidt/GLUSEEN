The Global Urban Soil Ecology Education Network is an international collaboration seeking to provide hands-on educational experience for
students while pursuing basic ecological research in urban soils. This is a repository of datafiles, bioinformatics codes, and statistical
analyses conducted in the processing of our global urban soil microbial community data.
